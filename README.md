# Doodle Bot

This is a bot/simple program to create daily reports to check who has completed our doodle polls. I'm making it to check who hasn't answered polls yet so we can enforce group policies.

Currently it requires a `config.js` file exporting settings used by `main.js`. I'm not gonna outline the structure yet because it's likely to change soon as I work towards making this an actual bot not just something that posts to webhooks.
